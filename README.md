# Simulation
The SMARC simulator contains 2 git submodules:

- **SMARCUnity**: the unity project, including scenes and rendering settings. Open this in [Unity Hub](https://docs.unity.com/en-us/hub)
- **SMARCAssets**:  a package containing all of the SMARC Unity assets and scripts including vehicles, dynamics, sensors and more. 

These are Unity projects/packages, not a ROS packages. The simulator can nbe run without ROS. Connecting to ROS requires the bridge described below.

## Installation

### 1. Get the project and assets

Choose one of the following set up:

#### Independently of SMaRC2
```
cd <anywhere>
git clone git@github.com:smarc-project/SMARCUnity.git
git clone git@github.com:smarc-project/SMARCAssets.git
```

Keep `SMARCUnity` and `SMARCAssets` next to each other. The project's `Packages/manifest.json` references the assets using `file:../../SMARCAssets`, relative to the `Packages` folder.

```text
<your anywhere>/                 # Or ~/src/ for a standalone installation
├── SMARCUnity/             # Add this folder to Unity Hub
│   ├── Assets/
│   ├── Packages/
│   └── ProjectSettings/
└── SMARCAssets/
```

#### As part of SMaRC2
You can do the above, OR this:
```
cd smarc2
git submodule update --remote --init simulation/SMARCUnity
git submodule update --remote --init simulation/SMARCAssets
```

### 2. Install Unity Hub

Install [Unity Hub](https://docs.unity.com/en-us/hub/install-hub). For Ubuntu, follow Unity's [Linux installation instructions](https://docs.unity.com/en-us/hub/install-hub-linux).

Also create a Unity ID as you would need it to sign-in in Unity Hub.

### 3. Add the project to Hub

In Hub, select **Projects → Add → Add project from disk**, then choose (depending how you have it set up):
- Workspace installation: `~/smarc_ws/src/smarc2/simulation/SMARCUnity`

Or

- Standalone installation: `~/<your_dir>/SMARCUnity`

### 4. Run the simulator

1. On the terminal run the command:
```bash
unityhub
```
Then, go to the project page and click on the SMARCUnity and wait for it to run. The Unity Editor's project window will pop up.
> [!WARNING]
> Open the project with the Unity Editor version specified in
> `SMARCUnity/ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt`. Opening it with a newer Editor
> can upgrade the project's cache and serialized files, after which the project
> might not work when reopened with an older Editor. If this happens, close Unity,
> restore any version-controlled files changed by the upgrade, clear the generated
> `SMARCUnity/Library/` cache, and then reopen the project with the intended Editor
> version. Unity will rebuild the cache automatically.
2. Open `Assets/Scenes` and choose a scene (for example `AllTheRobots.unity` or `KTHTank.unity`)
Alternatively, the simulation could also be run using CLI:

```bash
cd <simulation_dir>
unity open ./SMARCUnity
```
3. Press `Play`
4. In the game mode, enable **Unity Control** for keyboard control

Key mappings are:

<!-- TODO -->
| Key | SAM action |
|---|---|
| `W` | Forward thrust |
| `S` | Reverse thrust |
| `←` / `→` | Horizontal thrust-vector angle—turn left/right |
| `↑` / `↓` | Vertical thrust-vector angle—pitch |
| `C` | VBS toward 100% |
| `Space` | VBS toward 0% |
| Neither `C` nor `Space` | VBS at 50% |
| `F` | LCG toward 100% |
| `R` | LCG toward 0% |
| Neither `F` nor `R` | LCG at 50% |
| `Q` / `E` | Differential-thruster roll while applying forward/reverse thrust |


You can find more detailed instructions on using all available vehicles, sensors, connections, UIs etc. [here](./Documentation/README.md).

## Installation for non-SMaRC projects

We rely on a few non unity asset store packages, so follow the instructions below to install the package into your project.
It might seem like a lot of things to do, but all of the operations can be done in the Unity editor and should not take more than a few minutes.

We recommend using the the Editor Version **2023.1.13f1**. 


### Install Packages for Unity from Github

1. Open Package Manager window (Window | Package Manager)
2. Click `+` button on the upper-left of a window, and select "Add package from git URL..."
3. Enter the following URL and click `Add` button

```
https://github.com/GlitchEnzo/NuGetForUnity.git?path=/src/NuGetForUnity
```
```
https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ROS-TCP-Connector.git?path=/com.unity.robotics.ros-tcp-connector
```
```
https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/URDF-Importer.git?path=/com.unity.robotics.urdf-importer
```

### Install NuGet packages

Once you have installed NuGet, install the following packages.

1. Click the NuGet dropdown at the top of your Unity Editor (Sometimes requires editor restart to appear).
2. Manage NuGet packages
3. Search and install:
  *  MathNet.Numerics
  *  CoordinateSharp

### Configure the ROS Connector

Our codebase is scripted towards ROS 2. You will need to change some default settings to ensure your messages are compiled for ROS 2.
The code will work with ROS 1, but you will need to update the scripts to support ROS 1 messages yourself.

1. Open the ROS settings menu (Robotics | ROS Settings)
2. Change the `Protocol` to "ROS 2"
3. Click on "Apply"
4. Wait for the compilation to finish.

### Install SMARC Unity Assets

Once all the dependencies are installed and configured, you can install this package using the same method as before.

1. Open Package Manager window (Window | Package Manager)
2. Click `+` button on the upper-left of a window, and select "Add package from git URL..."
3. Enter the following URL and click `Add` button

```
https://github.com/smarc-project/SMARCUnityAssets
```

## ROS connection
- We use the [ROS-TCP-Endpoint](https://github.com/KKalem/ROS-TCP-Endpoint) package to speak to ROS2. 
  - You can use [this simple script](https://github.com/smarc-project/smarc2/blob/humble/scripts/unity_ros_bridge.sh) to run the bridge and then use `rviz2` and `rqt` to check what things look like in ROS.
- The ROS connection is especially useful when you are running headless.

### ROS Messages
These are generated from within the editor:
- Robotics -> Generate ROS Messages...
- Fill in the fields in the pop-up
  - Usually you can not generate these INTO the SMARCAssets package, so place the RosMessages folder anywhere for now
- Cut/Paste the generated RosMessages folder into `SMARCAssets/Runtime/Scripts/VehicleComponents/ROS/Core/RosMessages`

## Help!
If at any point, you needed help, got the help, and the help was not about using Unity (Good example:"How do I make my vehicle buoyant?". Bad example: "How do I move this object in the editor?"), please [open an issue in github](https://github.com/smarc-project/SMARCUnityAssets/issues) (and tag it with "Documentation" if you can). 
That way, we can identify gaps in our documentation and hopefully add them in for the next person.
